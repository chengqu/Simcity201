####Yunan Lin: Draw the entire World Map for simcity, including the roads, MouseOver Effect, and Night Animation every several minutes; added the animationPanel for each building when clicked;
               In charge or the House stuff, can add Person into the house, and updated the Person's condition after finishing task in the house; The house can do : Sleep at home, Eat at home, Store Groceries
               at home, Pay bills at home if he is a Renter, and also, a Person can do multiple task in the house. Basically, I design the house, implemented it, including the guis(take a look at the TV Animation Stuff!!!), 
               and Unit Test it for three scenarios(Eat at home, sleep at home, store groceries at home);
               Did the integration of restaurant and person, restaurant and Store interaction.
