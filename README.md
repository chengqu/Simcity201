               -Control Panel for adding new people into the Sim City. Users can choose custom data members to add to the                
               person to influence the Person's decide function. Person's info shows upon clicking the person's button.
               
               -Coded the ApartmentGui. Added in an apartment layout and coded the ApartmentPersonAgent to go to fridge to                  
               store and retrieve groceries, go to stove to cook food, go to table to eat food, and go to living room                  
               when doing nothing. Coded part of the ApartmentPersonAgent agent code to be functional with the gui.
               
               -Designed the design document for the Car in transportation.
               
               -Unit Tested the newMarket agents to ensure that they work and fixed bugs in the newMarket found when unit                  testing.
               
               -Integrated the newMarket into own restaurant to make sure that the newMarket is used for purchases.
               
               -Added in GUI images for buildings in Sim City main map.

####Cheng Qu: Design, implement, Transportation Agents and Transportation guis. Test transportation agents. Implemented cardelearAgent in Market

####Yunan Lin: Draw the entire World Map for simcity, including the roads, MouseOver Effect, and Night Animation every several minutes; added the animationPanel for each building when clicked;
               In charge or the House stuff, can add Person into the house, and updated the Person's condition after finishing task in the house; The house can do : Sleep at home, Eat at home, Store Groceries
               at home, Pay bills at home if he is a Renter, and also, a Person can do multiple task in the house. Basically, I design the house, implemented it, including the guis(take a look at the TV Animation Stuff!!!), 
               and Unit Test it for three scenarios(Eat at home, sleep at home, store groceries at home);
               Did the integration of restaurant and person, restaurant and Store interaction.
