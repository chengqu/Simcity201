##Contributed Work

####Gueho Choi:

####Eric Liu:

####David Ivan:
	-Designed the structure of person with help from Ryan
		-Helped come up with the scheduler, the enter function, and the decision function. Helped come up with idea
		 for having the person calls certain agents and buildings based on his internal roles and flags, rather than owning
		 the roles agents directly. 
		-Implemented almost all of the functions and have maintained and updated it. 
		-Unfortunately i haven't been able to test it, but there isn't much testing that needs to be done for it
	-Designed the apartments
		-Designed the ApartmentPerson agent, which completely works
		-Made apartment complex and apartment animation panel, which allows users to "flip" through apartments based on how
		 many people are in the apartment.
		-Mostly implemented it, however much of the gui stuff was done by eric
		-added some extra functionality, such as getting evicted from the apartmentcomplex if they are a renter and haven't
		 paid all their bills
		-all scenarios tested and working
	-Made the initial design of the house
		-It was redesigned by Lin though. no implementation or testing on my part
	-Helped people with general implementation and bug fixes
		-helped people use some of the backend systems that ryan and i came up with to implement other peoples functionality,
			-ex: helping qu get the trucks going, by showing him how to use the global map to pull the restaurants and get the cooks
