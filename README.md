##Contributed Work
###All Helped on:
               -Implementation of the Decide function within the Person Agent
               
               -Design and Implementation of the Market Store
               
####Gueho Choi:

####Eric Liu: 
               -Control Panel and Person Panel for adding new people into the Sim City. Users can choose custom data                     
               members to add to the person to influence the Person's decide function. Person's info shows upon clicking                
               the person's button.
     
               -Coded the ApartmentGui. Added in an apartment layout and coded the ApartmentPersonAgent to go to fridge to                  
               store and retrieve groceries, go to stove to cook food, go to table to eat food, and go to living room                  
               when doing nothing. Coded part of the ApartmentPersonAgent agent code to be functional with the gui.
               
               -Designed the design document for the Car in transportation.
               
               -Unit Tested the newMarket agents to ensure that they work and fixed bugs in the newMarket found when unit                  testing. Created eight tests for the Market to test all normative scenarios.
               
               -Integrated the newMarket into own restaurant to make sure that the newMarket is used for purchases.
               
               -Added in GUI images for buildings in Sim City main map to improve user interface.

####David Ivan:
	-Designed the structure of person with help from Ryan
		-Helped come up with the scheduler, the enter function, and the decision function. Helped come up with idea
		 for having the person calls certain agents and buildings based on his internal roles and flags, rather than owning
		 the roles agents directly. 
		-Implemented almost all of the functions and have maintained and updated it. 
		-Unfortunately i haven't been able to test it, but there isn't much testing that needs to be done for it
	-Designed the apartments
		-Designed the ApartmentPerson agent, which completely works
		-Made apartment complex and apartment animation panel, which allows users to "flip" through apartments based on how
		 many people are in the apartment.
		-Mostly implemented it, however much of the gui stuff was done by eric
		-added some extra functionality, such as getting evicted from the apartmentcomplex if they are a renter and haven't
		 paid all their bills
		-all scenarios tested and working
	-Made the initial design of the house
		-It was redesigned by Lin though. no implementation or testing on my part
	-Helped people with general implementation and bug fixes
		-helped people use some of the backend systems that ryan and i came up with to implement other peoples functionality,
			-ex: helping qu get the trucks going, by showing him how to use the global map to pull the restaurants and get the cooks
	

####Josh Faskowitz:

####Cheng Qu: 
		 -Designed and impelemented BusAgent,CarAgent, StopAgent,TruckAgent,  PassengerAgent, BusGui, TruckGui, CarGui,PassengerGui. Basically every moving thing outside the building. Let the bus and truck only goes on right, which is legal. everything is working
               -Designed and implemented layout of buildings in the world.
               -Tested All transportation agents to work
               -designed and implemented MarketDealerAgent but doesn't work.

####Yunan Lin:  Draw the entire World Map for simcity, including the roads, MouseOver Effect, and Night Animation every 		several minutes; 
		added the animationPanel for each building when clicked; 
		In charge or the House stuff, can add Person into the house, and updated the Person's condition after 			finishing task in the house; 
		The house can do : Sleep at home, Eat at home, Store Groceries at home, Pay bills at home if he is a 			Renter, and also, a Person can do multiple task in the house. 
		Basically, I design the house, implemented it, including the guis(take a look at the TV Animation 			Stuff!!!), and Unit Test it for three scenarios(Eat at home, sleep at home, store groceries at home); 			Did the integration of restaurant and person, restaurant and Store interaction.
